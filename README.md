## MBM Report Generation from Excel as the DB
### Bad in concept, pretty decent in theory

works for ip_data and transportation_data excel files


* how to clone and run
    * git init
    * git clone
    * py to exe 
        * pip install pyinstaller
        * pyinstaller --onefile 'main.py'
        * this is pretty bad, because it creates an exe thats like 90mb even though the code is very light, but it works
